 Technologies: React Native | Firebase | WebRTC (for video calls) | Google Maps API
 Designed and developed a mobile application to provide immediate medical support by 
connecting patients to nearby hospitals and alerting nearby people during emergencies.
 Enables users to quickly request emergency help by locating and routing to the nearest 
hospital using low-traffic roads via Google Maps API.
 Integrated real-time video call functionality using WebRTC, allowing patients to directly 
connect with doctors for remote consultations.
 Developed a siren activation feature that users can trigger silently, helping alert nearby users 
or neighbors for assistance when the user cannot speak or call.
 Used Firebase for real-time database, user authentication, emergency request logging, and 
cloud messaging for instant alerts and notifications.
 Built an intuitive and accessible user interface using React Native, ensuring cross-platform 
support (Android/iOS).
